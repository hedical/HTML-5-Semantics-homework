# HTML 5 Semantics practice


First exercice to practice how to get some HTML 5 operational code

# Motivation


This exercise was the opportunity to understand how to clean some HTML code. I was also interested to practice flexboxes, and I tried to work on the CSS code improvement.

# Future Improvements
